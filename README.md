I'm very new, this is my first project that i've ever done without prompting. so just open the file in a code editor, if you have g++ it should run when you hit the button to run it.

I made this for the number guessing game project over at, https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game. i saw it and my exact thoughts were, ok yeah, i can do that. followed breifly by, oh god what do i do.
